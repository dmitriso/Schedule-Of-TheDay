# Schedule-Of-TheDay

## Description

As an employee with a busy schedule. Ive created a daily planner that you can add important tasks and events to be completed. This project is meant to help organize the users daily activities and manage their time better. 

The planner is very simple to use! At top of the planner page underneath the title and opening message the current date is displayed. Then the user is presented time blocks that span the range of a 9am-5pm work day schedule. Depending on the current hour then each time block is color coded to signify the past, present , and upcoming task. The user may input any text into the field and click the button to save that task to that slot. The users new task is saved to the windows local storage to be utilized no matter if the page is refreshed.

Each time block is automatically color coded to represent wether it is past the task hour , currently on the task hour, or the task hour has yet to occur. When the user refreshes the page all user saved tasks persist.
